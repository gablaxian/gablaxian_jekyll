Some time around the last Steam sale I knew I couldn’t keep buying games I never intend to play. Or, at least, do not have time for. If I cared about the game, I would have bought it sooner, really. Instead, all I could feel was the burden of games unfinished. The list of which was ever growing. So I decided to make a literal list of those unfinished games and try to beat them before moving on. Or at least make a good dent. And here is that list. My games of shame:

    ## Currently Playing

    - Uncharted Collection
    - Cave Story+
    - Final Fantasy XV

    ## Never Finished

    - Last Guardian
    - Everybody's gone to the rapture
    - Witcher 3
    - Forza Horizon 3
    - Bastion
    - Sonic Generations
    - Dark souls
    - Bioshock
    - Skyrim
    - Planescape Torment
    - Torchlight 1&2
    - Darksiders
    - GTA V
    - Sam & Max: Season 2
    - Bioshock infinite
    - Final Fantasy VIII
    - Dungeon Siege
    - Fable 3
    - LEGO Batman 2
    - Lost Winds 1&2
    - Mirror's Edge
    - Max Payne
    - Fallout 1&2
    - 7th Guest

I started adding in estimated completion times to the games, but that got depressing.

I’ve had to be a bit ruthless with the list. All games are (relatively) new, or at least are still easily accessible (7th Guest). But I haven’t gone so far back as Dreamcast, SNES, etc&hellip; I can look into those another time.

I also allow myself to be playing a maximum of three games at a time. So, if one game does not appeal on any given game session (or the device is inaccessible&hellip;), then I can play one of the others. There is no particular order to the games, and they can be moved around at will.

I am, however, realistic when it comes to new releases. You have to _want_ to play a game. So if something comes out I’m hyped about, then that might go straight to the top of the list (or if I get an urge to play a particular, existing game).

I also keep a list of game which I call ‘Eternals’. Games which can’t really be beaten, or those which I just like dipping back into:

    ## Eternals

    - Overwatch
    - Terraria
    - Titanfall 2
    - Diablo 3
    - Street Fighter V
    - Cities: Skylines

So there we have it. My games of shame.

I keep a record of what I’m currently playing and what I’ve recently beaten on the [home page](/), if anyone cares. Anyway, gotta run. There are games to be played!
