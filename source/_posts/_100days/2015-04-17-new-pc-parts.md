It's always the same when it comes to buying new PC parts. Particularly if that PC is a dedicated gaming machine. Once you've clicked 'buy' on that new component – provided it's not a peripheral, like a mouse – you spend the whole of the delivery time playing _every_ game you own to give yourself a baseline. Then once you get your new item, you replay _every_ game you own, _again_, so that you can marvel in the moderate enhancements.

And I don't regret a thing.
