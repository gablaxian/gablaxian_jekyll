Sometime last week, it was decided that we should totally make our own beer for UX London. Several enthusiastic ‘Hell Yeah’s and a week or so later, 8 Clearlefties found ourselves in the arse-end of Croydon at the brewery for [Cronx beers](http://www.thecronx.com/).

Here, we were given an overview of the beer-making process and a look at the equipment used, then, after questions, it was straight on to beer tasting! We started with the so-called base beer, which they brew. Then, through flavour extracts, we were able to taste variations on that beer. One set of variations were hop-types, another, fruit/floral notes. Using those, we could combine each to see how well the flavours of chosen hops combined, or how the fruity flavours enahnced or utterly ruined a hop flavour.

At the end, like the UX company we are, we dot-voted on various concoctions and decided on a victor. That victor will be coming to a UX London near you (just the one, obviously), named and labelled by us. PREPARE THYSELF.
