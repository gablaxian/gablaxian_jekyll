As of today, various members of [Clearleft](http://clearleft.com) are participcating in a 100 days challenge, of which there are [many](https://giveit100.com/) [examples](http://100daysproject.co.nz/). Ours lives at [clearleft100days.tumblr.com](http://clearleft100days.tumblr.com/).

The idea is to, and I quote, 'Repeat a design operation for 100 days straight'. The 'design' aspect is flexible. Choose a thing and do it for 100 days straight. I've chosen to blog for 100 days. Nothing groundbreaking, sure, but it’s something I’ve always felt I struggle with. Maybe this will help fix that.

Most of it will probably be inane drivel, likely documenting that day’s meal, my walk into work or possibly the air-speed velocity of an unladen swallow. Who knows. It’s the doing that matters.

Of course, everyone else is using Tumblr for theirs. Something to do with reblogging? Reposting? Whatever description the kids are using these days. But, I’ve got this site and jekyll blogging system right here and I worked _really_ hard on it. So that’s what I'm using.

So that’s our 100 days. 99 more to go.
