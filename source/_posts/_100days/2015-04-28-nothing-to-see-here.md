Seriously. I've got nothing. I'm spending all my spare time just trying to wrangle a new design for this site that I've got nothing to actually discuss! I don't even have any lights on at the moment. Just pushing pixels around. As a non-designer, I'm finding it incredibly hard to envision a typogrpahy focused, subtle, retro aesthetic with the odd 'delighter'. I feel like I'm getting closer though.
