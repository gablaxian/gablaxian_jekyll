Today us Clearlefties were honoured to receive [Dave Gray](http://www.davegrayinfo.com/) to host his workshop on [visual thinking](http://www.davegrayinfo.com/visual-thinking-school/). It came highly recommended from a handful of my colleagues, so much so that they were right back there doing the workshop again!

The day started out with us listing several techniques we’d like to learn or improve upon, such as ‘drawing people’, ‘lettering’, ‘sketchy, not scrappy’ and more. David then bolstered this by furnishing us with numerous techniques for general sketching and rapidly illustrating intent.

We learnt a bucket-load or practical stuff and got to draw silly stuff for a day. Win.
