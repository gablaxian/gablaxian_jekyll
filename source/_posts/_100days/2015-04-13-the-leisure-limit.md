I've been struggling to think of a better way to phrase it, but I guess it'll do. You see, rather than a point at which something must end, it is, conversely, the point at which can only happen _from_.

Let's rewind. What I've been finding lately is a creeping malaise. When I was freelance, and I wore the project management hat (badly), I worked. A lot. Evenings and Weekends, sometimes. Because as a freelancer you worry. A lot. Fast-forward to today, where I work at a great place, with and for, great people, my time is better managed (by someone else, obviously. Hi Jess!). My evenings are my own once more.

Whether it's a reaction to the stresses of freelancing, whether I just love watching shows and playing games, or whether it's just plain old laziness, I struggle to do anything meaningful in my, now time abundant, evenings.

I have _plans_. Oh, we all have _plans_. Doing the cleaning, cooking up a nice meal, editing the videos of that last JS meetup you attened. Those little side-projects you've got stacked up. Easily eschewed in favour of something less taxing; more _fun_. It's too often I return home and, feeling uninspired, the first thing I do is turn on a console/PC/Media Box and there goes my evening. If you have children maybe this isn't a problem. You probably don't have much of a choice.

So I'm making a stand. I am implemeting a Leisure Limit. It is tentatively 9 o'clock. But that could be _too_ extreme and may get dropped that back to 8. We'll see. Either way, there is a hard limit to when I am able consume games or media. And with those extra hours prior, I can do something a little more productive; Cook up a nice meal, read a book, work on my JS game, hell, even clean my bike.

There are exceptions, sure. It does not apply to spending an evening out, with friends, at the twice-monthly local gaming night, or heading down to the cinema. But then, these are _events_. The social side, of which, starkly contrasts an inevitable night in a darkened room, lit only by the glow of an aging monitor, conversing virtually, to the lines of a predetermined script.

I hope I can make it last.
