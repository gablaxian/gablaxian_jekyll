I had a nice little surprise today, as I perused the Amazon Prime Video catalogue, where I spotted they had Black Mirror within their collection. Charlie Brooker's alternate realities became known to me once the second series began leaving me, until today, still having never seen the first. And, while I was happy to rectify this little oversight, I didn't really intend to watch all three episodes. But I guess that's a testiment to their quality. An excellent series.
