Yesterday before I left work, colleague [James Bates](https://twitter.com/jvbates) asked, and later posted to Slack, if anyone was up for a morning ride before work along the South Downs Way which lies just to the North of Brighton. He already had [Mikey](https://twitter.com/mhjallan) in tow and they were setting out at 7am. I literally laughed in his face.

But here's the thing. When James suggests something, it always comes with some subconscious guilt trip. Like, if you don't do it, you are a Lesser Human<sup>tm</sup>. It kind of sits there in the back of your mind, festering. So after I got home and posted about how much I still love my bike, I thought, I couldn't not do a ride like this. It's what the bike was made for.

And so it was that at 7.15am I found myself heading out to meet them part way along, at a point most convenient to get to from my house. And sure, by the end I was a gibbering wreck, hoofing it down dirt tracks high above Brighton more than made up for it.
