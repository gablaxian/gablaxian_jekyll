Keeping in the spirit of the 9 o'clock leisure limit, which, honestly, I hadn't intended to enforce over the weekend, I have spent the majority of the day looking at overhauling my website. You know, now that I'm posting to it and all.

I still want to keep to a 8/16 bit retro aesthetic, but looking at the state of CSS font handling, or lack, thereof, I decided I had to part with my pixel fonts. But, on the upside, I found out about Chrome and Opera's adoption of the CSS attribute and value, `image-rendering: pixelated` which is great news for pixel artists everywhere! Now pixel-perfect images can be scaled to our hearts' content without losing the lovely pixellation. And we don't even have to produce multiple versions for differing dpi devices.

Unfortunately, as the title suggests, I can't show any of the new changes because it's only half-finished. Some of the images, most notably, the logo, need updating and design is my weak point, so it's taking the longest. Also, much of the time I spent on the site was actually around site structure; SASS architecture, grunt tasks, page layout, and understanding Jekyll a bit more.

All in due time, my friends.
