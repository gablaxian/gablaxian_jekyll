I talked in a previous [post](http://gablaxian.com/2015-04-08-fightlab.html) about Fightlab, a local bi-monthly gaming event across the road from my office. I hung up my arcade pad and decided to mostly head over for the beer and game banter. However, a bit like Diablo 3, I find myself slowly getting back into the world of Ultra SFIV.

Before Fightlab, I hadn't really played much Street Fighter since Street Figher 2 on the Megadrive. And even once I started playing a bit of SF IV I was playing it like I played SF 2. You pick Ken or Ryu and fireball or dragon punch your way to victory. But Street Fighter has come a _long_ way since my first forays. Now, if you let it, it can be a world of Combos, Focuses, Reverses, FADC, Cross-overs, Cancels and Frame-counting.

There are reasons tournaments and championships are held for this game. If you decide to dig, you will be exactly where I currently am: Lost. Here be dragons.
