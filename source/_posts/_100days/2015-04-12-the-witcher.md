Over the last couple of days I've sunk a bit of time into The Witcher, the first game from Polish company, CD Projeckt, sister company to [GoG](http://gog.com). Based on a popular Polish series of books by the same name, there are currently two Witcher games already out and a third due in a month or so. They've sat in my ever-expanding games library for a number of years now, so with the imminent release of the third, I thought this might finally be the time to give them a proper playthrough.

Unfortunately, they are RPGs; types of games not synonymous with the word 'short'. They are already competing with a number of other games I want to be spending my time in. The Witcher is several years old now, and didn't have a huge budget at the time so is pretty rough around the edges. It has a certain charm, but also just enough quirks to provide a fair barrier to entry, particularly compared to other, more familiar RPGs which tend to have those steeper learning curves due to all the statistics and lore.

This is one of those times you question whether to just go straight for the sequel (a far more accomplished game) instead. But then if I did that, why not just wait for the third? Tough call.
