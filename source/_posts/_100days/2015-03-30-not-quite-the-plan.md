It turns out that on Mondays Seoul is *closed*. Like, the whole place. Every time we thought ‘Oh, that place is closed today, what about we do this other place, then?’. Nope. That place was closed, too. The fallbacks of our fallbacks were closed.

We did manage a lovely trip to a cemetery, but then, in a case of perverse fortuity, most of today was actually spent in our hotel room whilst I recovered from a case of the peanut allergy. A disastrous day by any holiday’s standards. Yay.
