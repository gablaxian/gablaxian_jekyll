I have never been good with history. Memorizing all those facts and figures, then writing _billions_ of pages in answer to a single exam question. It was not enjoyable. But, strangely, when I visit a new country, my first thoughts are to learn about its history.

Over the last few days we’ve been steadily building a picture of Seoul and Korea’s tragic past which culminated today in a tour of the DMZ between North and South Korea, then a tour of the Seoul Museum of History. And after it all I still can’t fathom how a place like North Korea exists. How, through after occupation from a communist country it continued to exist in such a fashion. Did they happen to believe in a communist dictatorship before the occupation, or were various leaders brainswashed? I simply do not understand.

But I’ll tell you one thing. I’m a little more interested in history.
