Maybe it’s due to being based in the outskirts of South Seoul, but taking a trip to the Han riverside reveals it’s not the city of sprawling super structures I had expected. Of course, with all the smog, they could just be hiding… I’ll uncover more in due time as we venture further in.

First impressions are that this country is *foreign*. And I’ve been to Japan three times. Although, I’ve long been a fan of the Japanese culture and was somewhat familiar before my first trip. Here, I’m struggling to remembering how to say ‘hello’, ‘goodbye’ and ‘thank you’. They don’t have a secondary alphabet, akin to Japanese kana, so I’ve little hope of deciphering any text. Very few people seem to speak much English, even if it’s a coffeeshop with English writing littering most of its walls… Pointing at menus and gesturing is probably going to be the primary form of communication this week.
