At this moment, I’m sitting on a relatively empty train, headphones on, bag of Twirl bites open and a can of G&T in hand. We’ve stopped at Gatwick. But I’m not getting off here. I ride this train to the end of the line and further still, all the way to Heathrow. From there it’s a mere 11 hour flight direct to Seoul Incheon Airport.

“You did say Seoul, didn’t you?” Yes. Yes I did. What suprised me is the reaction I got when I told people I was going to Seoul. Maybe it’s just England, but it seems like a lot of people aren’t prepared for South Korea to be a travel destination. I couldn’t even find a local currency exchange outlet which stocked the Korean Won.

So why am I going? Well, some of you may know that my girlfriend, [Linzi](https://twitter.com/nice_reminder), is currently enduring a year in Japan on their, government funded, JET course, teaching english to school children. I managed to get over to Japan for Christmas and New Year, about 4-5 months after she begun, and we thought that would be the only time we’d meet up. It was generally agreed that instead of her spending what little holiday JET participants get on big trips back to the UK, it made more sense to use this opportunity explore the Asian cultures.

The route from Brighton to Kirishima, where Linzi is stationed, is fairly painful; not something you’d want to repeat if you could help it. A better alternative is to meet somewhere in the ‘middle’. Now, factor in several months of regressing back to my old gaming-in-underwear habits and we’ve got ourselves a bit of money kicking about for an impulsive trip to an unexplored Asian city with my delectable かわいいさま。Can’t wait!
