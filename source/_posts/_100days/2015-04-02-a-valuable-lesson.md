During our trip to the DMZ, we were able to buy North Korean wine. In related news, today we learnt that North Korean wine is freakin’ terrible.

I think it may have fizzed a bit when opened. It also had bits of, what we assumed to be, grape still floating about it in. Either that or the most sediment we’ve ever seen.
