I do like returning to Manchester. This time it’s for [Up Front Conf](http://upfrontconf.com/), a conference put on with help from long-time friend, [Dan Donald](https://twitter.com/hereinthehive). Manchester has been crying out for a proper web conference in all the time I lived there, yet only now has it come to pass.

I ended up in Manchester after I got accepted to my first choice of University, the, now defunct, <abbr title="University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology">UMIST</abbr>. Once I had completed my course I pretty much forgot to leave after quickly getting a ‘real’ job, not that I had anywhere to go, but I have a history of living in numerous places around the globe, so I assumed I'd continue on in that tradition. But three years at University gives you a grounding. I knew places and people and that was comforting.

It took living in Manchester over ten years, having 2 full-time jobs, then going freelance to finally leave. By the tenth year I really was ready to move, too. The very city I learned everything about the Web in, slowly felt like it lacked any kind of Web community or identity as friends left, meetups stopped, the myriad of companies within just never communicated. At least, that’s the way I saw it. There are still many great people, agencies and clients there. I guess I just felt like it had stagnated.

But, upon heading back, I feel a sense of home. I know Manchester. By living there so long and during such formative years, it is still comforting; knowing it’s secrets, hangouts, all the nooks and crannies. It is a great city to live in. It has everything, including the ability to not be London while having it. Also it has a TARDIS.

I look forward to, in just a couple of hours, seeing some familiar faces and places and maybe seeing a rekindling of the Web community I knew and loved.
