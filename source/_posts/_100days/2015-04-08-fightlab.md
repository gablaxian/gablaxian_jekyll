Just across the road from our office, is a place called Sticky Mike’s Frog Bar. It serves as both a bar and gig venue for smaller acts. But, on the second and fourth Wednesday of every month, it is also host to an event called ‘Fightlab’.

The name may conjure up thoughts of the book or film, Fight Club, but, thankfully, the reality is far more tame. Instead, it is simply a night of games; Super Street Fighter 4 and Marvel vs Capcom 3, by default, and others depending. It has existed for a few years now, maybe not in that specific venue, and it has an established group.

After my first visit I jumped in at the deep end. Started getting hold of all the SF4 updates, bought an arcade stick, signed up for the tournaments. But, inevitably, interest wained and it was obvious I didn’t have the time or inclination to play the game enough to compete at these guys’ level. So, now I mostly just head over for the beer and banter. And you know what? That’s enough.
