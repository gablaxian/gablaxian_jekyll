What are we, like, 30-ish days into this 100 days thing and I've talked about games... what, 3 times? Maybe hardware a couple of times. Seems crazy given gaming takes up about 90% of my free time. So, really, what I'm saying here is that I may start talking more about games, particularly those I've been playing currently. Which is a lot because my games library is [_obscene_](http://steamcommunity.com/id/gablaxian/games/).

I'll start tomorrow, because it's 17:00 and all I've played so far is 30 mins of SNES games on the Wii.
