With my limited design skills I finally sorted out a logo. But that was merely the start of the problems. Where I though I was half way to re-designing my blog, I feel like I'm right back at square one. I've tried various background colours with differing font colours and link colours and all sorts. I feel like I'm no further to finally giving my site the makeover it deserves.
