We are currently one beer away from the end of our last day in Seoul. A week, while just enough to see almost everything that interested us, was barely enough to time to spend together in the midst of Linziâ€™s year in Japan.

Tomorrow morning we must wake early-ish and spend a fair amount of time on subways and trains travelling to our respective, different airports. Though, thankfully, they lie in series with mine only 30 minutes further.

Seoul, while a somewhat impulsive holiday destination; fulfilling the role of being unvisited by either and closer and easier to get to for me, has surprised us both. Knowing very little about the country, city and the culture, we have both come to love it, vowing in future to return once more.

Its past: tragic. The people: lovely. And the city: Vibrant. We highly recommend it.
