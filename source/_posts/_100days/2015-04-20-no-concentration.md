I should have known it was going to be one of 'those days' when, after turning off my alarm this morning, I blinked and woke up again nearly an hour later. Then, after cycling in to the office (which is about 90% downhill) I was near breathless upon opening the front door.

I don't know where my energy went today. I'd be looking at my monitor during work and it's as if my brain was saying "aaaaand what do you want me to do with this, exactly?". Urgh.

Anyway, now that I'm home I think I shun the leisure limit an hour early and just drink a beer and play some games. It's unlikely my brain will let me do much else.
