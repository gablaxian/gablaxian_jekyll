I just have to get something off my chest. Lately, I’ve been addicted to Domino’s. The day when we went on our beer tasting session, we got a bit of Dominos delivered to the brewery to tide us over and, though I ate little, it kindled something within. A need. A realisation that I, too, could have delicious pizza delivered. And now, when I’ve hit rock bottom (which is apparently more often than I care to admit, during a day of gaming) I have been known to reach out for a quick hit of pizza pleasure.

I do know, thankfully, how my mind works. When it craves a thing, I can do little but oblige, but I know it moves on as quickly as the craving starts. So, it is often easier to indulge in these flights of fancy and let my body become sick of them than deny myself, and thereby let my mind continue to crave.
