Coffee in Seoul is not very good. We’ve tried it numerous times and it has always disappointed. Good thing I had some Small Batch coffee to use up and decided to bring my Aeropress.

Today we explored the the ‘Palace District’ where we stumbled upon an underground museum, sauntered for hours around the grounds of Gyeonbokgung palace, ran away screaming from a nasty looking restaurant and returned, quite pooped, back at our hotel room with beers and crisps. Good day.
