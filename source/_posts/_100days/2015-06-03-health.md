It’s hard to believe that around three years ago I was fully Paleo. These days I almost couldn’t be further from it. It’s definitely not a diet you can do if you want to have, you know, friends or a social life. And as much as I try to keep it up, I’m a sucker cheeky trips to the Pub which, when you go back to working in an office, gets suggested often enough. But I guess what’s worse are those 'couple of beers' you pick up on the way home and before you realise it, you’ve done that almost every night of the week and you can’t be bothered to cook so you get take-out... just me?

Anyway. I recently ordered this pair of shorts online. Medium. Just like my other shorts, but these ones just didn’t fit right. They were telling me I’d let myself go for too long. I mean, where did I go so wrong that I can’t even fit into _medium_ anymore. I AM SHAME. So this week I’ve really been putting in the effort. Eating cleanly, stopped drinking and even got a climb just earlier today. Now, if I can just get back into cycling to and from work, then all the better.
