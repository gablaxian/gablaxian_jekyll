Some of you may know that I started writing a series of articles on [creating a game with Javascript](http://gablaxian.com/articles/creating-a-game-with-javascript/). If there were dates on those posts, it would show I've not updated or progressed it in, probably, over half a year. What's up there isn't the current state of the game. I am actually further along on my local copy, but I hit a point where the next step could be a number of different things, so I decided to do some exploratory coding and ran into a bit of a wall.

I've been idly thinking of the problem on and off since I last made an update and what I'm finding is that even if I find time to get into the game headspace, no one is really covering the particular aspect in their blogs, journals, discussions on game development. Tutorials mostly cover making games using one of several widely available engines. Not useful.

*However*. Just yesterday I gave it another shot and came across [Hand Made Hero](https://handmadehero.org/), where one man, Casey Muratori, with a 30 year history in game development, is chronicling his journey to make a full game written from the ground up. No engines, no libraries. And every line of code is shown and discussed.

This is amazing. I've taken a quick look at some of the videos and it looks like it should help me bash down this wall I've hit. So once I've cleaned up my blog a bit, it'll be time to do the impossible: resurrect a side-project.
