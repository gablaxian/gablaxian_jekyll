[Marc Thiele](https://twitter.com/marcthiele) is one of the nicest guys you could ever meet. Thinking back, I met this laid-back, 80s-metal-haired, snowboarding German at, I believe, the first ever New Adventures conference in Nottingham, all those years ago. So even then, I was aware of the conference he runs in Düsseldorf, Beyond Tellerrand.

Over several years, I continued to bump into Marc at the many conferences he and I attended. And each time we grew a bit closer and each time my shame mounted because I had still yet to attend Beyond Tellerrand. Well, this year it was going to change. No longer would I let my mind believe that attending a conference abroad was some huge undertaking. Frankly, getting to conferences within England is just as time-consuming and costly, if not more, than conferences in our neighbouring countries. So this year it did change.

I write this as I fly back to Gatwick on a flight which took off close to the intended departure time and to the intended airport (Well done, EasyJet) after having a day to take in Düsseldorf and let the last few days sink in.

It was obvious from pretty much the moment I registered that Marc not only cares about his conference, but the people who attend. The goodie bag had practical items like a battery pack and USB multi-cable. We also got a re-usable sports bottle with water dispensers located around the foyer and a mug which you could use to get free coffee from a few vats. Of course, there were also two bars from which to buy other types of coffee, along with soft drinks, pretzles and hotdogs. And because that wasn't quite enough, one of the sponsors was providing free muesli. Off to a good start.

The conference takes place in the 'Capitol Theatre' which interestingly had a seating setup of one half tables with lamps and the other layered seating. With the room bathed in a red light, it felt almost like you'd entered a burlesque show. It was all very relaxed which was really the theme of the conference. Each talk was roughly 45-mins (I think) with a 30 min break between each. I approve of this setup as it completely prevented me from phasing out from staring too long at a brightly lit stage.

Marc manages to get a great line-up and, as was the case this year with Sara Soueidan, goes to great lengths to make sure they can even get the necessary visa to even enter the country. I won't go into each of the speakers and their talks. I liked the variety of the talks. I personally think all the speakers are very good at what they do, all having great stage presence and ability, and their content was relevant, informative and enjoyable. What any one person gets out of a conference is subjective so that one is up to you and the subject of a different blog post.

My favourite talk was from Christian Heilmann, who is always great. He echoed something that I had been thinking for a while which was that we to be careful we’re not solely preaching to the choir, which all our conferences are wont to do. It's all good us knowing the latest and greatest techniques, but we need to spend as much time getting the clients to understand what the web is, and what it is definitely not; a platform to promote their app, for instance.

To sum up, Marc hosts one of the best web conferences around. If you can make it one year, I can't think of a better way to spend that conference budget.
