The title was originally more explicit, but because this is a family website I toned it downâ€¦

Basically I was attempting to return home from a few stops out of Brighton. There is normally a train which can bypass Brighton and stop at the station closest to my house. The trainline told me it existed. I got to the station where it appeared to have arrived. But when I got on, my station we not listed. I got off. Then I was stranded trying to decide what course of action to take. I only wanted to go about 4 stops yet the trains couldn't even get that right. Did it even stop at my stop? I don't know! Public transport in this country is literally *the worst*.
