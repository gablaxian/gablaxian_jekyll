title: The Worst Advice

After the long morning bike ride along the South Downs last Friday, my bike is still somewhat caked in grass and dirt. It occurred to me that I've never serviced my bike since I bought it and given that it's a pretty expensive bike, it really is a thing I should be doing. Leaving chains to rust, stretch and generally dry up will damage other, more expensive components.

So I ask the other office bike enthusiast about bike maintenance and the general response is to 'Google some videos' and do it myself (as opposed to getting it serviced). This is basically the Worst Advice Ever<sup>tm</sup>. Now I'm wading through contradictory information about sprays, degreasers, lubes, bike chain cleaning tools washing order, you name it.

Basically, my advice to you kids is: Don't buy nice things. Buy something cheap, run it to the ground then throw it out and get another.

FML.
