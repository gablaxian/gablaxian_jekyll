title: Seaford
---

The weather did not start out well, which is typical as I’d planned to go and see my friend, Al Power, who now lives over in Seaford, an area I’d yet to explore. But thankfully by the time I made it over there for lunch, it was near perfect blue skies. A bit windyl perhaps, but I’ll take that.

Seaford is another of the seaside towns along the South coast, not far from Brighton. Its beach spans Westward, uninterrupted, all the way to Newhaven and beyond which is quite a sight. And to the East are some fantastic chalk cliffs which are easily scalable for some great views.

Sure, the town itself doesn’t have much of a high street, and the average age of its population is probably about 60, but with such an expanse of countryside on its doorstep, it serves photographers and hikers alike, admirably. On a nice, sunny day, it has great views and is full of character. An excellent day.
