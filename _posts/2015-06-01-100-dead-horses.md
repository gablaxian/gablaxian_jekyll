title: 100 Dead Horses
---

Yeah, so not only have I fallen off the 100 days horse... again... it’s basically dead now. But, you know, let’s keep flogging that dead horse.

I’ve felt so out of it these last two weeks. Conference after conference has led to something of a burnout. Socialising is hard work! Coupled with that is the somewhat relentless project I’m on at the moment. My days are pretty much: Get to work, headphones on, smash out code, go home and play Street Fighter/Diablo. Rinse, repeat. Then try and recoup on the weekends with more gaming. It’s likely that all the gaming isn’t helping with my overall energy levels, so starting this month I’m aiming to clean up my eating and get climbing a bit more. Just like I say every week.

Onwards!
