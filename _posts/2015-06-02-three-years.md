title: Three Years
---

Today marks the third year since Linzi and I 'got together'. It’s cray cray that only just over three years ago we first connected on [OK Cupid](https://www.okcupid.com/) and she told me she liked my beard. From those first messages it was a few months until we were officially an item, though it wasn’t until this year we finally figured out what that date was, having previously based it on fuzzy recollections.

Despite Linzi continuing to exist in another country, there was still a possibility to do something nice for this special occasion. I even _distinctly remember_ having an idea and then searching through the seedy passages of Affleck’s Palace while up in Manchester before [Up Front](/2015-05-20-up-front-2015). But it just wouldn’t be my brain if it didn’t chew over an idea for a while, come up with numerous alternatives then overthink them all until they’re just a jumbled mess of debilitating neuroses. There is a fine art to doing the first thing that comes to your head, ladies and gentlement; it prevents your brain from actually getting in the way.

So, obviously, today this happens:

It serves to remind me just what a THOROUGHLY USELESS CREATURE I AM. I’m generally just sorry. For everything.
