title: The 100
---

As I trawled through Amazon Prime TV shows one evening, a show called 'The 100' presented itself. It seemed to be well reviewed, according to the Prime reviews, but you really can't base a lot on those kinds of scores. Anyway, the premise appeared mildly interesting:

"In the series premiere, 100 young exiles from a dying space station are sent to the planet Earth 97 years after a nuclear apocalypse to see if it's habitable."

Dystopian future, you say? I'm down with that. Somewhat unfortunately it turns out that only under 18s are put in jail on this space station, as anyone over 18, whatever their crime, are 'floated' (shoved out the airlock into space). So, it's a group of 100 mostly teenagers who, since they're all 'bad' are completely cocky and can't do anything rationally and it all gets a bit Lord of the Flies. So it does get a bit cringe-worthy in places. But, to be honest, it's becoming a bit of a guilty pleasure. You put it on in the background and after about 10 minutes, you're watching the whole episode.

There's more to the plot, in terms of _why_ they were sent down, and what has happened to Earth in all that time away. But my verdict is: Mindless fun. Will probably keep 'background watching'.
