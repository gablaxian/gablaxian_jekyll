title: Bosnian Rainbows
---

Yesterday's post was pretty epic, so today I'll just quickly mention a band I've been listening to a lot recently: Bosnian Rainbows. I found out about them while uncovering what had become of the members of long-time favourite band, The Mars Volta. It turns out that Bosnian Rainbows was one of the projects that came about after their split, with guitarist and The Mars Volta co-creator, Omar Rodríguez-López providing his skills. This female fronted band has a varied, eclectic set of songs. A bit Björk-ish, punky and poppy with the odd funky bass line, their songs have become my earworms of recent days. Highly recommended.
