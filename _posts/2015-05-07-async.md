Tonight is [Async](http://asyncjs.com/)! Ever since it moved into our events space downstairs, I've been a regular attendee of this fortnightly meetup. It describes itself as a "JavaScript meetup" but in truth it expands out of that niche and into general web territory more often than we'd care to admit. It's a great night to meet up with local devs and have a drink and has helped me acclimatize to Brighton that much more. If you're in the area, I urge you to come on down.
