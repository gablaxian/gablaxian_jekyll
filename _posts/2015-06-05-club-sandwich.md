It’s Friday so I’m going to keep this short. This week the whole office’s minds have been blown when [Mark](https://twitter.com/allmarkedup) informed us what the 'club' in club sandwich stood for. So, mind blown straight away that it’s actually an acronym. Then, mindblown again because it stands for Chicken and Lettuce Under Bacon.

Boom. Life Changed.
