title: Gravity Falls

During an adventure to foreign lands, of all places, is where I came across a great new cartoon series to watch, courtesy of my wonderful Linzi, which is [Gravity Falls](http://www.disney.co.uk/disney-xd/gravity-falls/).

Created by Alex Hirsch and owned by Disney, Gravity Falls is a fun show about twins, Dipper and Mable, who are sent to spend summer vacation with their great uncle "Gruncle" Stan in Gravity Falls where weird stuff tends to happen.

Alex Hirsch has a bit of Seth MacFarlane genius about him, whereby he voices several of the recurring cast and then numerous bit-part characters throughout the series. A rare gift. I noticed, even from the first episode, that this show has already generated a number of memes, for example, the gnome puking rainbows:

It’s somewhat unsurprising I’d like this show, given that Hirsch started out as a writer and storyboard artist alongside J.G. Quintel, who went on to make The Regular Show and Pendleton Ward, who you will know as the creator of Adventure Time.

The characters are great, and there are plenty of quotable lines. I’m looking forward to seeing how this series progresses.
