title: UX London
---

So, it’s that time of year again. As the front-end developer for the UX London site and primary updater-er of its information, it feels like I’ve been staring at that site for decades. Though, with that in mind, I couldn’t tell you the full line-up, or what the talks or workshop topics are, but I have a pretty good idea where all the apostrophes, commas and italics sit, along with sthe structure of the SVG we used how we got he clock to work on multiple browsers. Making websites can be pretty weird like that.

This year will be the second time I’ve attended. As it’s a Clearleft event, we all get the chance to book out the 3 days and join in the shenanigans. The speakers were great last year and Andy, with his history of conference organising, speaking and attendance, knows how to repeatedly find other great speakers.

I did miss the first day, waht with my travelling down from Manchester, but the next two days look to be fun. And that has nothing to with the free artisinal coffee and hand-picked street food vendors we get for lunch options. Nope. Honest.
