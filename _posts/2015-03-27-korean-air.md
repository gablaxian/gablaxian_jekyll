title: Korean Air
---

After what seemed like **3 billion years**, I am now lying comfortably on my hotel room bed, some atrocious, cringy Korean J-Pop (K-pop?) on the TV and the remains of travel Pringles in hand. I’m not allowed to enjoy Seoul until Linzi arrives tomorrow so I’ll use this time on the next 100Days blog post.

I was pleasantly suprised with Korean Air. I paid a little bit more for a direct flight from London to Seoul because it totally makes sense that you’d pay more to take a less efficient route. A cheaper option was the Russian airline, Aeroflot, which I can only presume is a fleet of Ladas with wings. Thought I’d give that one a miss. Anyway, in contrast to my recent flight to Japan with Lufthansa (which wasn’t *bad* exactly, except for that bit where they forgot to send my luggage), Korean Air impressed me. The plane felt more spacious, which was down to the more efficient sizing and placement of the overhead lockers. So even thought the flight was full, it didn’t feel packed. The walls had a nice oriental effect on them which counted for more than I would have expected. Then, when I’d reached my seat way, waaaay in the back, there were power outlets between each seat and a usb charging slot on the back, next to the surprisingly good touchscreen LCDs and control units. Hell, I was even able to use my own headphones instead of being forced to use whatever crappy, probably overpriced, Maplins knockoffs other airlines still restrict you to these days. And it’s a good thing too, as the choice of films was very respectable, which included Interstellar.

Colour me impressed.
