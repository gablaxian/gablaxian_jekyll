title: New Monitor
---

Some of you may have seen on Twitter today, in amongst the general flak I got for having a dirty keyboard, that I took delivery of a new monitor. The Dell UltraSharp U2515H, to be specific.

After it was delivered, I unpacked it, plugged it in and checked to see if it worked–which it did–then I was pretty much straight out the door and into the office. Then my evening was taken up by the local JS meetup, Async. So I've not had time to run it in properly. But my instant reaction has been 'wow'. This is a seriously lovely monitor.

More on it later!
