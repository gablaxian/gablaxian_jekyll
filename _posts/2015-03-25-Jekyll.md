There was, and in fact still is, one mental barrier to my involvement in our 100 Days Project, which is that this site is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) a static site generator. Unlike certain other static site generators, such as [Statamic](http://statamic.com/), there’s no admin panel. Jekyll appealed to my inner (and outer) developer with its command line interface and barebones approach.

However, that approach binds it to a machine that has the site files and Jekyll installed, which does not lend itself well to portability. While it is generally unlikely that I’d want to blog from anything other than my development machine, with holidays and/or conferences coming up, the ability to, perhaps, blog from a phone or tablet suddenly seems like a very appealing prospect.

I shall be having Thoughts<sup>tm</sup> on this.
