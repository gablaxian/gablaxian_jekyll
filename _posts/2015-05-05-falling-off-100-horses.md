title: Falling Off 100 Horses
---

For all one of you who read these posts (Hi Linzi!) you'll notice I haven't posted a 100 days post in a number of days. I fell off the horse and hard. Not going to lie. After the previous epic Diablo post which took me _hours_, I felt I needed a break and, well, the break just kind of rolled over to the next busy night, and then weekend... and bank holiday... Ah well. Shit happens.

I had thoughts of quitting the 100 days challenge because one of my missions of the project as a whole was to get more proficient getting my thoughts into written form, more often and more proficiently. Both of those have happened. I also wanted to be able to write the longer form posts, like the Diablo 3 post. That too, happened. I felt my goal had been reached. I even have other longer form posts planned in draft. However, once Linzi quizzed me on the missing posts, and the subsequent to explanation of this rational, she basically gave me the reason why I actually needed to continue: "I thought the idea was just something, even tiny, every day?". Painfully concise. Either I suck it up and spend a while writing the longer form pieces as part of 100 days, or they are an addition to the challenge, but the challenge stays as exactly that: A challenge. The ability to perform this task repeatedly for the 100 days is a challenge unto itself, not so much having to come up with new things to write. And it is a challenge I owe to myself. To see to the end.

Anyway, my colleagues suggested that instead of backfill. I just get back on the horse. So here I am, with saddle in hand, spurs on my feet and whip in my mou–...err, where is this analogy going exactly?
